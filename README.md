# Fraud_transaction_detection_using_ML

I began with a large dataset containing raw data. I conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the dataset's characteristics. By visualizing the data, I aimed to identify which features were most influential in determining transaction outcomes. Subsequently, I engaged in data modeling and statistical analysis to detect fraudulent transactions. To achieve this, I employed machine learning models for training, ultimately developing a model capable of effectively detecting fraudulent transactions.
